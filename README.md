# convex-value-project

In its current state - ConvexValue is more of a profitable proof of concept than a trailblazing business.

To grow into a trailblazing business I believe we must become a well-oiled machine composed of the following 3 branches:

 - [x] Technology
 - [ ] Operations
 - [ ] Community

***Technology***

This branch is in charge of r&d, design, building, and maintaining the ConvexValue product.

***Operations***

This branch is in charge of making sure the company itself is running smoothly. From managing finances, to handling license agreements, lawyers, to taxes, payroll, and human resources.

***Community***

This branch is in charge of sales, marketing, tutorials, customer support - and everything related to the existing and potential users of the product.
